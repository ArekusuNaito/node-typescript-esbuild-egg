# Read Me

This is a repository to use as a `egg / seed / template` as a foundation for other `node+typescript` projects
Clone this repo and a lot of useful things are already set up.

- `eslint`
- `esbuild`
  - To compile and bundle the project
- `ts-jest`
  - Globals are not injected. This is to make things clearer and not infer there's jest code globally available.
